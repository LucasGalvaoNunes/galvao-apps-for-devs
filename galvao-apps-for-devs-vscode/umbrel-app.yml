  Run VS Code on your Umbrel and access it in the browser so you can
  code on any device with a consistent development environment. This way you can
  use your Umbrel not only to code from any device, anywhere, but to also speed
  up tests, compilations, downloads, and more.


  By running all intensive tasks run on your Umbrel, preserve battery life of your devices when you're on the go.
